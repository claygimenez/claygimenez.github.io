  <div class="post">
  <p>For 2.75: Medical Device Design, a graduate engineering course at MIT instructed by Professors Alex Slocum and Charlie Sodini, I worked with a small team to to develop a device to measure and evaluate eustachian tube functionality in collaboration with a clinician from Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital.</p>

<p>The end result was a proof of concept of the measurement technique, its capabilities, and an approximate form factor and usage scenario for the device.  The design is currently patent pending and further development is ongoing.</p>

<p>Eustacian tube dysfunction is the leading cause of otitis media, or middle ear infections, the most common acute medical condition in children with 16 million annual episodes in the US alone.  Effective evaluation of eustachian tube function would enable preventative care and ensure proper diagnosis, thus substantially reducing antibiotic use in children.</p>

<p>The primary challenge facing the team was the development of an effective non-invasive measurement technique.  Evaluating eustachian tube functionality requires distinguishing very small differences over long periods of time in the pressure of the middle ear.  Many potential noise sources complicate matters.  The final design validated a particular measurement technique and tentatively addressed potential noise sources for the technique.</p>

<p>My main contributions were system design, enabling effective communication between the varied stakeholders, the design of the prototype mechanical structure, and collaboration in the design of the control system involved in the measurement.</p>
