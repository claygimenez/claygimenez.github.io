Built a new mobile experience for Wistia's customer-facing app. We created an
interface that feels friendly and clean thanks to a strong architecture and
careful event management.

At a high level, here's how it works:

- Rails as a RESTful JSON API
- ActiveModel::Serializers pass data from Rails to Backbone
- Backbone.js to organize the front end

I love this project because it's transparent on multiple levels. From a UI
perspective, what you see is what you get. Available actions are clearly
delineated and easily accessible.

On the engineering side, the structure of the app follows its function. A glance
at the code reveals how the app works. As a small, interdisciplinary
engineering team, this is really important for Wistia. Anyone can come into
the project and make changes without a steep learning curve.
