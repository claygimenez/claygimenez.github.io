Maker is a side project I built with a friend while learning Rails and
Backbone. Our "breakable toy," but also something we were both passionate about.
We built a place for makers to show off what they build.

- **Back end:** Ruby on Rails as a RESTful JSON API
- **Front end:** Backbone.js
- **Design:** Designed for makers, Responsive on devices
