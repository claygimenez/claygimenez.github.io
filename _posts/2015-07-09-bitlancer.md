### About the Project

[Bitlancer](http://bitlancer.com/), a Boston-based cloud consultancy, hired me to build them a new marketing site, complete with blog! The project took a little under 2 weeks time to complete.

### Product Requirements

- **Time**  
We needed to get the site live as quickly as possible. The old site was not helping the company grow.  It had to go.

- **Simplicity**  
  - The new site needed to look nice and clean and easy to use.
  - The codebase would be used by a large part of the company. As such, the site needed to be easy to set up and use. No mysterious code or black boxes.
  - The client wanted a clean slate that the company could iterate on, gathering data and feedback to refine the product.

- **Science!**  
Gotta play nicely with HubSpot tracking and Google Analytics.  More on that below!

Considering these, I decided to build the site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a small but mighty blog-aware static site generator.  It's quick to set up and easy to understand. And! features like [collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) and [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from), along with [GitHub Pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) compatibility make it difficult to pass up.


### Graphic Design

The client wanted the site to look modern, clean, and representative of the team.  I kept the color palette simple.

The company already had a great brand blue that was light, bright, and cheery.  I brought in white and a blue-tinged charcoal gray as neutrals and made some supportive colors by lightening the charcoal and darkening the brand color.

### Character

Bitlancer is made of people!  It's a very fun company, and we wanted to highlight that.

Clicking the heading on the [People](http://bitlancer.com/people/) page spins the team's photos around to reveal playful sketches.  Creating these sketches might have been my favorite part of the project.

### Marketing Magic

On to business... Because Bitlancer's blog is one of the most frequent ways that customers learn about the brand, I added modular calls to action below the post content.

The call to action above supports the site's mission--drive visitors to submit that contact form (below).

Once the form is submitted, the data is collected in HubSpot.

### Conclusion

[The site's live!](http://bitlancer.com/)  So far the redesign has been very successful, massively increasing the number of leads generated from the site. Check it out!
