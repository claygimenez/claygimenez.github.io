Redesigned the thruster system for a commercial submersible vehicle to increase
its depth rating 2x and reduce manufacturing costs 10x. The most critical
design change was the adaptation of an off-the-shelf motor to replace the
costly custom beast used in production.

- Designed in Solidworks
- Prototyped using a mill and lathe
- Tested motor on-site, depth testing was done by the company
