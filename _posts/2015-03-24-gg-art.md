###Branding

The brand is centered in the concept of a stained glass phoenix. Beyond the obvious
connection to Phoenix, the place, the phoenix is one of the more fantastic
mythological creatures out there.  And it symbolizes hope and rebirth... All good
things as far as God's Gables branding goes.

We like stained glass as a reference to tradition, but it's also a
great inspiration for visual styles that will hopefully resonate with the site's
users. There's something really comforting about stained glass as an art
form--clean lines, warm colors, and craftsmanship throughout. We also figured that if we
took from traditional prayer settings in building an online prayer community, we
could reduce the barrier to its newness as we started building a user base.

###Colors

It was important that the color scheme supported the ideas we wanted to convey
about the God's Gables brand. We knew we needed to start with some fire tones. We focused
on finding a good red and then supported it with similar shades of orange
and yellow.

We chose a cranberry red. Among its friends, we think it looks old and
new, warm, and friendly. We threw in the blue as cool accent color and a contrast
to the flames.
