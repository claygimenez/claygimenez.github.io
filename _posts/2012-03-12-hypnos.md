I worked on a startup in 2012 researching and designing solutions for
sleepwalkers.

It became clear early on that the market and business model weren't there to
support the company I wanted to build, but here's an icon I put
together for presentations and web mockups.

I wanted to create something simple and geometric with strong references to
nighttime--something showing that nighttime could be *a good thing.*
