I worked on a startup in 2012 researching and designing solutions for
sleepwalkers.

It became clear early on that the business model wasn't there to
support a growing company, but here's an icon and rough color palette I put
together for presentations and web mockups.

For the icon, I wanted to create something simple and geometric with strong
references to nighttime--something showing that nighttime could be *a good
thing.*

Colors!

- Text
- Brand color
- Accent 1
- Accent 2, links

Looking at this now, I'd probably swap the turquoise for a happy-looking maroon
(if I could find one ^_^).
