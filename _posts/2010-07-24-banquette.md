Growing up, my family had a strangely shaped breakfast
nook. Look at it! It's got a big bay window with an extra leg on one side.

Our rectangular dining table wasn't a good fit for the space, so my father and I
designed and built a better solution. The project took ~1 month start to finish.

The table seats 15 comfortably.
