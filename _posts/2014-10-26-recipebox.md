[This is my Angular + Rails sandbox!](https://maryfood.herokuapp.com/) The app is simple:

- Stores recipe cards
- Sorts recipes by category
- Shows individual recipes in detail

Wiring up Angular with Rails was stupidly easy. It felt weird plugging black
boxes into my templates everywhere, but the boxes seem to work really well...
And this would have taken me hours more to build in Backbone, so mixed feelings
on all that. I think this app took me an hour or two to get up and running on
heroku.

And the color scheme is just something I wanted to try. Blues and reds.
