This project began as a breakable toy for introducing my little sister to the
world of software design. I mentored her for a year as she learned HTML, CSS,
and the basics of JavaScript and Ruby.

When she saw a need in her community in Phoenix, AZ, the project grew into what
is now God's Gables, an online prayer sharing community.

She was determined to make it real, and built most of the features herself. We
paired on more complicated flows (e.g. *friending*), and I helped her translate
abstract ideas and business needs into well-defined features and projects.

Over Christmas, I worked on branding and visual design for the site. The brand
is centered in the concept of a stained glass phoenix. Beyond the obvious
connection to Phoenix, the place, the phoenix is one of the more fantastic
mythological creatures out there.  And it symbolizes hope and rebirth... All good
things as far as our branding goes.

We like stained glass as a reference to church and tradition, but it's also a
great inspiration for visual styles that will hopefully resonate with the site's
users. There's something really comforting about stained glass as an art
form--clean lines, warm colors, and craftsmanship throughout. We also figured that if we
took from traditional prayer settings in building an online prayer community, we
could reduce the barrier to its newness as we start building a user base.

It was important that our color scheme supported the ideas we wanted to convey
about our brand. We knew we needed to start with some fire tones. We focused
on finding a good red and then supported it with similar shades of orange
and yellow.

We chose a sort of cranberry red. Among its friends, we think it looks old and
new, warm, and friendly. We threw in the blue as cool accent color and a contrast
to the flames.

**I'm currently finishing up some other graphics for this site and working on UI
flows in preparation for launch. I'll post an update when this project's
finished.**
