I designed an interface to allow users of a site to pray for each other.

The challenge was to visually convey the gravity of praying for someone through
a simple web interface.  Praying is a pretty serious action to check off by hitting a 12-14
pixel icon of some sort, so I worked to build something unique to make this
experience delightful.

I used prayer candles to accomplish this.  Users can light a candle to show
someone that they're praying for them, and the candles remain lit for 24 hours.

This detail was central in humanizing the app and securing the goodwill of
users.
