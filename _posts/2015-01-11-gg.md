###Background

This project began as a breakable toy for introducing my sister to the
world of software design. I mentored her for a year as she learned HTML, CSS,
and the basics of JavaScript and Ruby.

When she saw a need in her community in Phoenix, AZ, the project grew into what
is now God's Gables, an online prayer sharing community.

She was determined to make it real, and built most of the features herself. We
paired on more complicated flows (e.g. *friending*), and I helped her translate
abstract ideas and business needs into well-defined features and projects.

I tackled branding and visual/interaction design for the site.

###Branding and Visual Design

The brand is centered in the concept of a stained glass phoenix. Beyond the obvious
connection to Phoenix, the place, the phoenix is one of the more fantastic
mythological creatures out there.  And it symbolizes hope and rebirth... All good
things as far as our branding goes.

We like stained glass as a reference to tradition, but it's also a
great inspiration for visual styles that will hopefully resonate with the site's
users. There's something really comforting about stained glass as an art
form--clean lines, warm colors, and craftsmanship throughout. We also figured that if we
took from traditional prayer settings in building an online prayer community, we
could reduce the barrier to its newness as we start building a user base.

It was important that our color scheme supported the ideas we wanted to convey
about our brand. We knew we needed to start with some fire tones. We focused
on finding a good red and then supported it with similar shades of orange
and yellow.

We chose a cranberry red. Among its friends, we think it looks old and
new, warm, and friendly. We threw in the blue as cool accent color and a contrast
to the flames.

###Interaction

We needed something special to bring the whole experience together--a way to visually
convey the gravity of praying for someone.

I decided to use prayer candles to accomplish this.  Users can light a candle to show
someone that they're praying for them, and the candles remain lit for 24 hours.

This small detail was central in humanizing the web app.

###Conclusion

I loved working on this project.

Teaching my sister how to build web products and seeing her grow was really rewarding.
And as a design exercise, this was fantastic.  We brought an old concept to a new
space and made it beautiful.  We had the freedom to innovate on interaction design and
were able to do something really nice for the community.

We built something amazing, and I'm proud of it.
