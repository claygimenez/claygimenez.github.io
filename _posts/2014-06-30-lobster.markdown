I designed, modeled and manufactured an animatronic lobster with a small team as an exercise in rapid prototyping and project planning.  We created Leonardo in one manufacturing cycle spanning three weeks.

With only enough time for one full cycle, we had to lock down and test key mechanical design elements fast.  We tested joint clearances, hinges, minimum thicknesses, and the like with one quick test print in the first few days.

For the next week, we dove into aesthetic and mechanical design.  I focused on the biomimetic tail.  Turns out, lobsters swim backwards.  They rapidly flick their tails downward and fly through the water.

To mimic the motion while allowing proper manufacturing clearance, I connected the tail elements with modified cylindrical joints.  Various elastic elements about the flexural axis hold the joints together and give the tail a curled resting state.  A servo motor driving a simple cam cranks the tail to a straight position via a central cable running the length of the tail.  The drive cam's shape then releases tension, causing the tail to flick back to its resting state.

For bonus character, I added green LED underlighting in the tail.  Plus LED eyes and a hint of iridescent green in the paint job... the lobster may be secretly evil (or at least blighted).
